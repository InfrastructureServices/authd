        REQUIREMENTS &amp; SETUP 

        <ol>
          <li>
            Building<br>
             Although authd was built and tested on Red Hat Linux
            9, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Core 1 &amp; 2,
            it will probably compile on any recent 2003/2004-era
            GNU/Linux distro with openssl and recent versions of
            the GNU tool chain (compiler + make) and GNU C library.
            

            <p>authd does not require autoconf. If needed, change
            any defaults by editing the <samp>config.h</samp> file.
            To build, simply run "<kbd>make</kbd>"</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Installing<br>
             "<kbd>make install</kbd>" will install
            "<samp>in.authd</samp>" and any translations in
            "<samp>/usr/local/sbin</samp>" and
            "<samp>/usr/local/locale</samp>" respectively, so
            you'll need to set the <kbd>make</kbd> variable
            <var>prefix</var> if you want the files to go somewhere
            else than "<samp>/usr/local</samp>". It will install as
            the filename "<samp>in.authd</samp>" to reflect that it
            is intended to run as a inetd/xinetd hosted server; in
            other words, server input/output is connected to stdin
            and stdout. 

            <p>If you're using encryption, put a one line pass
            phrase in the file "<samp>/etc/ident.key</samp>" (or
            another place if you change the default location via a
            server option), making sure the file is readable by the
            authd process and NOT readable/writable by others
            ("<kbd>chmod o-rw</kbd>"). <strong>If the permissions
            are not set correctly, authd will refuse to
            encrypt.</strong></p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Running<br>
             authd should be able to read
            <samp>/proc/net/tcp</samp> and/or
            <samp>/proc/net/tcp6</samp> to actually match users to
            ports-- although it will run without these files. 

            <p>A sample xinetd configuration file has been
            provided; copying <kbd>xinetd.conf.auth</kbd> to
            <kbd>/etc/xinetd.d</kbd> should work for Red Hat
            distributions. Be sure to make any changes needed to
            the default values and path as needed then
            restart/reload the xinetd daemon to use it.</p>

            <p>All of the options available can be seen with the
            "<kbd>-h</kbd>" option. Some notes on some of the less
            obvious options and parameters:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><kbd>--abrupt</kbd><br>
               If an error occurs after the client has sent the
              port pair, just drop the connection rather than tell
              the client (allowed by RFC 1413). authd may do this
              anyway for certain errors that prevent it from
              sending a reply (I/O error or an out of memory
              situation). "<kbd>--abrupt</kbd>" overrides
              "<kbd>-e</kbd>" and "<kbd>--xerror</kbd>".</li>

              <li><kbd>-E</kbd>[<var>cipher</var>]<br>
               Any symmetric block/stream encryption method
              supported by the installed openssl can be used as a
              parameter. To see a list of available
              <var>cipher</var>s, use "<kbd>openssl enc
              -h</kbd>"</li>

              <li><kbd>-l</kbd>[<var>mask</var>]<br>
               An optional base 10, base 8 (prefix with
              "<kbd>0</kbd>"), or base 16 (prefix with
              "<kbd>0x</kbd>") bit mask of system log priority
              levels that you wish to log. For example, an
              <var>mask</var> of 17<small><sub>8</sub></small>
              ("<kbd>-l017</kbd>") only logs messages of priority
              error or higher.<br>
              </li>

              <li>
                <kbd>--fn</kbd>[<kbd>=</kbd><var>uint</var>]<br>
                 Sends the full-name/"finger" info rather than the
                username. Some systems contain additional fields of
                information after the full name of a person, such
                as the office, office phone number and home phone,
                separated by commas. To display only the first
                field, specify "<kbd>1</kbd>". To specify up to two
                fields, specify "<kbd>2</kbd>"... and so on. 

                <p>If the "<kbd>-n</kbd>" option is also specified,
                then the numeric user id will be followed by the
                2nd up to <var>uint</var> fields providing that
                <var>uint</var> is greater than two.</p>
              </li>

              <li><kbd>--hybrid</kbd><br>
               Only applies to IPv6 addresses activated with the
              "--verbose" option. When used, the bottom 32 bits of
              the address with be displayed in the traditional IPv4
              format of four dot separated base 10 numbers rather
              than the IPv6 style of eight 16-bit colon separated
              hex pairs.</li>

              <li><kbd>--mapped=</kbd><var>ipv6</var><br>
               Allows IPv6 addresses whose first 96 bits (in other
              words, everything except for the last 32 bits) are
              <var>ipv6</var> to match IPv4 addresses which are
              identical to the bottom 32-bits of the IPv6 address.
              Useful for IPv6/IPv4 multi-interface environments
              where IPv4 addresses on different interfaces are
              mapped to IPv6 addresses. <em>It does not match IPv4
              "<samp>localhost</samp>" (<samp>127.0.0.1</samp>)
              with IPv6's equivalent (<samp>::1</samp>).</em></li>

              <li>
              <kbd>--os</kbd>[<kbd>=</kbd><var>rfc1340</var>]<br>
               Without an argument, it will display the same value
              returned by the "<kbd>uname</kbd>" command as the
              operating system, rather than "UNIX". You may wish to
              do this if the username returned (perhaps from pam
              talking to a Windows server) does not make sense
              within a traditional UNIX or Linux system.</li>

              <li><kbd>--resolve</kbd><br>
               Only applies to addresses and ports activated with
              the "--verbose" option. Causes <samp>in.authd</samp>
              to resolve addresses using nameservers, and replace
              service port numbers with their names, when
              available. <em>Resolving addresses slows the server
              down.</em></li>

              <li>
              <kbd>--username</kbd>[<kbd>=</kbd><var>login</var>]<br>

               Causes authd to report the username <var>login</var>
              for all valid established tcp connections, regardless
              of the actual user. <var>login</var> must point to a
              valid entry in the password database. If used in
              conjunction with "<kbd>-n</kbd>", the uid of the
              <var>login</var> will be returned. It will
              <em>not</em> change the uid number provided with the
              "<kbd>--verbose</kbd>" option.
              "<kbd>--username</kbd>" is useful for providing the
              actual user on single user workstations or servers
              that have changed their original associated uids to
              effective ones. It is also useful for masking the
              true username for privacy purposes (in this case
              authd is running as a dummy placebo server).</li>

              <li>
                <kbd>--verbose</kbd><br>
                 Adds the following information after the username
                or full name (depending on the option selected),
                separated by commas: 

                <ul>
                  <li>true userid number<br>
                   Different from "<kbd>-n</kbd>" which is affected
                  by "<kbd>--username</kbd>".</li>

                  <li>time stamp<br>
                   Date and time is provided in ASCII ISO 8601
                  UTC/Zulu (aka Greenwich Median, or GMT) time. The
                  day of week and time in the authd's local
                  timezone using the locale's format and encoding
                  are also provided in parentheses.</li>

                  <li>local address and port<br>
                   Port is separated from the address by a vertical
                  bar, "local" is from the perspective of the authd
                  server.</li>

                  <li>remote address and port<br>
                   Port is separated from the address by a vertical
                  bar, "remote" is from the perspective of the
                  authd server.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            The authd daemon will not read any input from stdin if
            port pairs are specified as parameters. Also, only the
            first port pair will be processed unless the
            "<kbd>-m</kbd>" option is specified.
          </li>

          <li>
            Testing 

            <ol>
              <li>Run "<kbd>netstat -A inet -n</kbd>" and find an
              established tcp connection.</li>

              <li>
                Input the two ports prefixed with colons as single
                command line argument (no whitespace unless the
                entire pair is enclosed in quotes for the command
                line parser), in the same order, separated by a
                comma. Example: 

                <p><samp>$ <kbd>/usr/sbin/in.inetd
                33201,6667</kbd></samp></p>
              </li>

              <li>Execute "<kbd>telnet localhost auth</kbd>" and
              type the two ports separated by a comma. <em>The two
              ports selected must have a foreign address of
              <samp>localhost</samp>, or <samp>127.0.0.1</samp> as
              well as a matching local address.</em> If they do
              not, a <samp>NO-USER</samp> error will be
              returned.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        DIFFERENCES FROM PIDENTD 3.0.18 

        <ul>
          <li>no config file<br>
           There is no "<samp>/etc/ident.conf</samp>", as all the
          options you need for a simple inet super daemon based
          server can be easily passed from the command line</li>

          <li>no special crypto tools<br>
           Key generation requires no special tools; a plain text
          pass phrase in a file is all that's required to encrypt.
          To decrypt, the openssl enc tool is used.</li>

          <li>no standalone server mode<br>
           For a simple server, launching via the ubiquitous
          inetd/xinetd is all that's needed. The super server
          provides most of the options present in pidentd.</li>

          <li>no protocol extensions<br>
           The <kbd>VERSION</kbd> and <kbd>QUIT</kbd> commands are
          unnecessary, a security risk in the case of
          <kbd>VERSION</kbd>, and a violation of RFC 1413 protocol.
          As they are not used by any client, they have been
          intentionally omitted. The "<kbd>-e</kbd>" option is
          instead used to mask error messages.<br>
          </li>

          <li>no automatic verbose encryption<br>
           Encrypting replies does not automatically include port
          and time information, which makes the reply excessively
          long. This information may be included with the
          "<kbd>--verbose</kbd>" option.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        HOW TO INCREASE PRIVACY 

        <ul>
          <li>You can allow users to either opt-out or opt-in from
          exposing their userid creating a file in their home
          directory (defaults are "<samp>~/.noident</samp>" and
          "<samp>~/.ident</samp>" respectively) and by setting the
          appropriate server option ("<kbd>-N</kbd>" or
          "<kbd>--ident</kbd>"). If both options are set then
          "<samp>~/.noident</samp>" will cancel out a
          "<samp>~/.ident</samp>" if both are present. If a file is
          present (or not present) which indicates that the user
          does not wish his information to be revealed, a
          <samp>HIDDER-USER</samp> error message is returned.</li>

          <li>
            If you just want an ident server to speed up broken
            servers that insist on some form of ident but you don't
            want to reveal any usernames, you can make authd "lie"
            to clients and tell them that the ports are owned by
            any arbitrary user with the "<kbd>--username</kbd>"
            option. When set to its default, the authd daemon will
            reply with either <samp>NO-USER</samp> errors or
            "<samp>nobody</samp>" as the port owner. Note that the
            argument supplied to "<kbd>--username</kbd>" must be a
            valid username. As some daemons do run as
            "<samp>nobody</samp>", you may wish to create a special
            username just for authd, such as
            "<samp>somebody</samp>", using the command: 

            <p><samp>$ <kbd>/usr/sbin/useradd -s /sbin/nologin -r
            somebody</kbd></samp></p>
          </li>

          <li>Encryption allows the system administrator owning the
          authd server to be aware of any ident information that is
          sent to him from remote sites while not unnecessarily
          exposing the usernames to any anonymous system.</li>

          <li>The "<kbd>-e</kbd>" option can be used to return
          <samp>UNKNOWN-ERROR</samp> instead of
          <samp>INVALID-PORT</samp>, <samp>NO-USER</samp>, and
          <samp>HIDDEN-USER</samp>.<br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        HOW TO USE ENCRYPTION 

        <ol>
          <li>put a plain text password or pass phrase that is
          terminated by a newline in the file
          "<samp>/etc/ident.key</samp>". Any additional data after
          the newline is ignored. If the pass phrase is in a
          different file and/or location, use the
          "<kbd>--passwd</kbd>" option to tell authd where it
          is.</li>

          <li>
            Make sure the owner/group and permissions are set so
            that the daemon (which usually runs as
            "<samp>nobody</samp>" if you use the default xinetd
            configuration file) can read it. Make sure that other
            can't read or write to it by using: 

            <p><samp>$ <kbd>chmod o-rw
            /etc/ident.key</kbd></samp></p>

            <p>authd will refuse to encrypt if this is not
            done.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            To decrypt the string, the "<kbd>openssl</kbd>" tool
            (using the "<kbd>enc</kbd>" sub-tool) is needed. If the
            base64 encrypted string is longer than 64 characters,
            it will need to be broken into multiple lines of 64
            characters or less (why? because openssl enc -base64
            doesn't like it any other way-- even though base64 only
            needs line breaks for e-mail). Feed the short base64
            string into the command: 

            <p><samp>$ <kbd>/usr/bin/openssl enc -d -base64
            -aes-128-cbc -pass file:/etc/ident.key</kbd></samp></p>

            <p>(Change the cipher to what's appropriate if you did
            not use the default for the "<kbd>-E</kbd>" authd
            option or the default was changed in
            <samp>config.h</samp>) Use <kbd>enc</kbd>'s
            <kbd>-in</kbd> option if the base64 encryption is
            stored in a file rather than being piped into
            stdin)</p>
          </li>

          <li><strong>Do understand the security ramifications of
          storing a password/pass phrase in unencrypted form on a
          file system.</strong> A system is secure if the cost of
          breaking the system is greater than the value of the
          data. Thus, do not increase the value of the authd
          password by using it anywhere else-- it should only be
          used to encrypt usernames &amp; userids and address/port
          info returned by "<kbd>--verbose</kbd>" -- (relatively
          low value information already readable by any local
          user)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        INTERNATIONALIZATION 

        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes, the username and/or gecos field returned
          by the system may not be in ASCII. An example would be a
          system that authenticates against accounts stored on
          Windows. Windows permits non-ASCII in their usernames and
          Name/Comment descriptions. In these cases, use the
          "<kbd>--codeset</kbd>" option to specify the character
          encoding/charset used. This will <em>not</em> convert any
          messages; it will simply inform the client as to the
          character encoding. The character encoding will
          <em>not</em> be sent to the client if the response
          appears to be all ASCII (all printable characters; no
          control characters), even if the option is
          specified.</li>

          <li>in the rare case that the string to be sent is not
          ASCII, a <kbd>--codeset</kbd> has been specified without
          the optional parameter, and the program is unable to
          determine the codeset used by the operating system,
          "<samp>X-UNKNOWN</samp>" will be returned as the
          codeset.</li>

          <li>
            You may want error messages (also local timestamps with
            the --verbose option) to be sent in a different locale
            from the current locale (inetd/xinetd often is
            configured to launch daemons in the "<kbd>C</kbd>"
            locale). The locale to use can be configured with the
            "<kbd>--lang</kbd>" option. By default, the daemon
            starts in the locale of the parent (usually
            xinetd/inetd) that launched it. If <kbd>--codeset</kbd>
            is also specified, it overrides the character encoding
            of the specified locale. 

            <p>Be aware that many system log daemons are not
            capable of handling non-ASCII yet, so combining this
            with the "<kbd>-l</kbd>" option may not produce
            readable syslog messages.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        EXTENDED ERROR MESSAGES 

        <p>These only appear when authd is launched with the
        "<kbd>--xerror</kbd>" option, because some server
        administrators do not believe in giving outsiders any
        useful information regarding the state of their servers.
        However, the <kbd>--xerror</kbd> is useful for diagnostics
        and troubleshooting.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <samp>X-PROC</samp><br>
             either <samp>/proc/net/tcp</samp> or
            <samp>/proc/net/tcp6</samp> was not in the format that
            authd expected it to be in. This may be because: 

            <ol>
              <li>the files are not part of a true linux
              <samp>/proc</samp> filesystem</li>

              <li>you are running a modified or experimental
              kernel</li>

              <li>you are running a kernel much newer than this
              program's last update and the file format has
              changed</li>

              <li>the proc file macros in config.h have been
              changed to point to something else</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li><samp>X-NAME</samp><br>
           A username was specified as an argument, but the
          username couldn't be found in the password database
          (<samp>/etc/passwd</samp>, NIS, or whatever the system
          uses).</li>

          <li><samp>X-UID</samp><br>
           The UID taken from <samp>/proc/net/tcp6</samp> or
          <samp>/proc/net/tcp</samp> couldn't be found in the
          password database.</li>

          <li><samp>X-FILE</samp><br>
           The pathname for the <samp>.ident</samp> or
          <samp>.noident</samp> file (home directory path +
          filename) was excessively long or bogus.</li>

          <li><samp>X-CRYPTO</samp><br>
           Suffixed by zero or more sequences of dashes and eight
          digit hexadecimal numbers. Either the pass phrase file
          couldn't be opened (wrong filename, doesn't exist, wrong
          permissions (must be readable by authd and NOT
          readable/writable by "others"), the pass phrase was too
          short for the given encryption, the crypto algorithm was
          inappropriate for the type of data (for example, not
          symmetric or does not permit non-fixed lengths), or some
          other internal (usually memory resource related)
          condition.</li>

          <li><samp>X-ERRNO</samp><br>
           Suffixed with a dash and a decimal number corresponding
          to what was returned by errno. Usually will occur due to
          an I/O error or an out-of-memory condition. On Linux,
          <samp>2</samp> is a "file not found" and <samp>12</samp>
          is an out of memory condition. Note that some out of
          memory conditions will cause the server to exit before
          printing a message.<br>
          </li>

          <li><samp>X-RFC1413</samp><br>
           The userid reply was longer than 512 characters and/or
          contained CRLF. While this shouldn't happen with sane
          data, this could possibly occur if an exceptionally
          long/strange gecos field and the combination of
          "<kbd>--verbose</kbd>" and "<kbd>--fn</kbd>".</li>
